Hey, this is Davide.<br>
I'm a a DevOps Engineer in Milan, with a strong Software Engineering background.

I like putting Arch Linux on things. I like hardware that doesn't phone home, unless that home is mine.

Wanna see what I enjoy working on? Here's a few projects of mine I'm particularly proud of:

- [EtchDroid](https://github.com/EtchDroid/EtchDroid) (`Kotlin`) is a popular app that lets you rootlessly write GNU/Linux distro images to USB drives on Android
- Wi-Se ([hw](https://github.com/depau/wi-se-hw)/[sw](https://github.com/depau/wi-se-sw)) (`KICAD`/`C++`) is a wireless UART adapter board
- My [shitty DNS proxy](https://github.com/depau/shitty-dns-proxy/) (`Go`) is very shitty but it has been solving all my home network DNS woes since 2022!
- LevIoT ([hw](https://github.com/depau/leviot-hw)/[sw](https://github.com/depau/leviot-sw)) (`KiCAD`/`Py`) is a custom PCB for my home air purifier
- I [reverse-engineered my laptop's fingerprint reader](https://github.com/depau/elanpoc) (`Py`) and wrote a driver for it for GNU/Linux in [libfprint](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libfprint/libfprint/-/merge_requests/330) (`C`/`GLib`).

I accept sponsorships and donations through different methods, see EtchDroid's [donations page](https://etchdroid.app/donate/). Please note though that while every contribution is deeply appreciated, donations don't equate to special treatment or support. All my projects are hobby projects, and I dedicate time to them as my schedule allows. I welcome suggestions and bug reports from all users, donor or not. I may be available for contract work though, send me an email if interested!

You may also find [my gists](https://gist.github.com/depau) interesting and useful.<br>
I have a separate place for forked repos: [@depau-forks](https://github.com/depau-forks)
